# SegFormer-based Tumor Segmentation 🚀
Efficient Transformer-powered semantic segmentation for next-gen tumor detection in medical images.

## ✨ Overview
Unleash the power of Transformers for medical imaging! This repo shows how to fine-tune a state-of-the-art SegFormer model for pinpoint-accurate tumor segmentation, leveraging the Hugging Face Transformers ecosystem. SegFormer’s hybrid Transformer+MLP design delivers blazing-fast, high-resolution segmentation—no matter your dataset size or image shape.

## 🔥 Why SegFormer?
No More Messy Upsampling: Forget heavy decoders. SegFormer’s all-MLP decode head fuses multi-scale features for crisp, pixel-perfect masks.

Resolution Agnostic: Hierarchical Transformer encoder (Mix Transformer) skips positional encodings—so your model stays robust, even with wildly different image sizes.

Plug-and-Play Variants: From featherweight B0 to powerhouse B5, scale your backbone to match your compute and accuracy needs.

Ready for 3D: SegFormer3D brings volumetric CT/MRI support with 3D self-attention and progressive downsampling (yes, true volumetric segmentation).

## 🧠 Architecture at a Glance
Encoder (Mix Transformer):
Four-stage hierarchy extracts features from fine to coarse, shrinking spatial dimensions while capturing rich semantics.

Decoder (All-MLP):
Concatenates multi-scale embeddings and runs them through lightweight MLPs—no complex upsampling, just pure efficiency.

End-to-End:
Input any image size, get back a dense segmentation map. Works seamlessly with PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.

## 🚀 Key Features
Lightning-fast inference and training

Outperforms legacy CNNs on benchmarks like ADE20K, Cityscapes, and medical datasets

Robust to varying input resolutions and modalities

Simple integration with Hugging Face & PyTorch workflows

## 🛠️ Dependencies
```bash
python >= 3.10, pytorch >=2.5.1, pytorch-lightning >= 2.xxx
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
Fine-tune on your dataset in just a few lines with Hugging Face Trainer or PyTorch Lightning.

Try different backbone variants (B0–B5) for the best trade-off between speed and accuracy.
